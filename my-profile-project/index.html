			<strong>Welcome, take a journey beyond my CV!</strong>

			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>
				Born and raised in Portugal, I studied <strong>BSc International Management</strong> at <strong>King's Business School</strong>, faculty of <strong>King's College London</strong>.
				After 4 years of learning, including a year abroad in <strong>Milano</strong> and <strong>Hong Kong</strong>, I graduated in September 2020 with a a high Upper Second Class Honours (2:1). Now, following a gap year dedicated to freelance projects and personal health care, I am now eager to finally start my career, learn the most and prove my value as a professional.

			<h2>What interests me</h2>
			<p>
				I am easily fascinated with everything that resembles <strong> innovation</strong>. By realising early on the mistake I had made by not following a STEM background, I focused in understanding the broad applications of then state-of-the-art technologies and their room for fellow newcomers with backgrounds alike. This was easily accomplished once I studied tech modules, joined tech societies, researched local tech environments every time I moved countries and attended entrepreneur-packed tech conferences. These experiences allowed me to swap my uncertainty regarding future endeavours and interests for full on passion for tech entrepreneurship.

			<h2>What I'm looking for</h2>
			<p>
				My number one priority is to get exposure in a startup/early growth culture. This means I want to be aware of all areas of the business so that I can learn the most from everyone. I also crave to be in a fast paced environment, where no day is the same, that welcomes new ideas and that like me, looks forward to challenge the status quo as a path for growth. <br> If I have applied to you it is because 1) I believe we think alike, and 2) I am confident my personal talent together with your work ethics and vision will bring each other a great amount of success.
